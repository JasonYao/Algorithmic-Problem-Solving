By Jason Yao

## Description
An repository to store all completed homework and recitation assignments for the
"Algorithmic Problem Solving (CSCI-UA-480)" class.

Date: Spring, 2016

Location: New York University

Professor: Dr. John Zhang

Language(s): Java (1.7.x due to older java compilers on the online judges)

## Course outcomes
- Developed more dev-ops ability from scratch (the ability to automatically start with boilerplate),
and to design a very efficient workflow for programming contests

- Developed greater understanding of algorithmic approaches, and more importantly their implementations.

- Learned the basics of competitive programming

- Competed in Google's 2016 [Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam)

- Implemented memoisation, recursion, graph traversal algorithms, and many more

- Learned max-flow & min-cut <-- cool stuff actually that surprisingly relates to machine image processing

- Became much more familiar than I already was with the Java API
